# ssa_name_search
Searches SSA data for names and occurences

Name data is from Social Security Agency (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html). Delete the pdf file and make sure all the files are of format 'yobYYYY.txt'

Run the script and it will create a figure with the name popularity by year. Note that SSA doesn't publish data on names if there are less than 5 names that year -- so even if a name has 0 returns there might be some!
